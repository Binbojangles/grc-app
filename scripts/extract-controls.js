Organizations maintain baseline configurations for development and test environments that are managed separately from the operational baseline configuration. Baseline configurations are updated when there are significant changes. Maintaining a baseline configuration requires creating a new baseline configuration when any significant changes are made to a system. Baseline configuration of systems also includes configuring systems to provide only authorized services and removing unnecessary services, protocols, and network ports.

Authorized individuals have credentials that include badges, identification cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the strength of authorization credentials needed consistent with applicable laws, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. This requirement applies only to areas within facilities that have not been designated as publicly accessible. Limiting physical access requires limiting access to facilities where systems and systems components are located, require maintenance, operate, or are otherwise accessed. Electronic key systems badge readers, biometric devices, or smart card readers to control access to facilities may be used in meeting the requirement. The use of electronic key systems (e.g., cypher, contactless, or prox) may not be acceptable in all situations. For example, a manually operated key system (e.g., pin tumbler) may be more appropriate for certain situations such as those where access is necessary in the event of electrical power loss or network disruption. Limiting physical access includes posted security guards at main entries to facilities, locked front doors, use of proper photo identification (ID) cards, and use of a key for an office. In a typical small business environment, the office may be in a small office building or office suite, and may use a conventional lock and key (e.g., deadbolt).

Boundary components include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a system security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected subnetworks). Restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems includes restricting external web communications traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses. Organizations consider the many technologies employed for boundary protection, including data loss prevention, intrusion detection and prevention, and virtualization systems. Commercial services are considered boundary protection services when the intent of the organizations employing such services is to monitor, control, and protect communications. Examples of such services include, boundary mail processing, boundary scan, and general computer wholesale, as well as web or email filtering. Organizations may employ both commercial boundary protection services and custom deployment of boundary protection devices and features, resulting in hybrid approaches to boundary protection. Organizations often are required to employ specific boundary protection devices (e.g., systems that work across the protocol stack including hardware and virtual equipment). Commercial devices and services may also be used to increase the bandwidth at the hardware layer and provide distributed processing or cloud-based capabilities. Systems may include firewalls with stateful inspection, proxy servers, gateways, or network monitoring tools, etc.Limiting access to data with a need-to-know provides additional safeguarding for the information system and the organization. This capability is applied to traffic from internal and external sources and applies to information communications technology-administered firewalls and routers or commercially contracted host-based capabilities (e.g., the organization contracts with an external Internet Service Provider [ISP] that provides a firewall service).

DMZs are used to provide additional protection for specific system components and information. Separating system components with an external service interface from internal networks such as by implementing a DMZ, provides additional protection for internal networks. The systems or services in the DMZ are the only systems or services that can be accessed directly from a public network, such as the Internet. The systems in the DMZ are limited in the services they provide (e.g., they may provide a proxy service for internal Web servers). Direct connections from the publicly accessible interfaces (e.g., Internet) to the internal networks are not allowed. Information flow between DMZ systems and internal network systems is controlled through a managed interface utilizing mechanisms such as firewalls, packet filtering routers, or application gateways. Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services. The risk management process is used to determine controls necessary for all services or connections. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers, and may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions.'

The plan must identity what system flaws and vulnerabilities in the organization\'s systems, applications, and web sites must be reported and to whom such reports must be made. The plan must define how quickly the reports must be submitted. The remediation actions must also identify timeframes for remediation actions. The time frames must be based on organization\'s assessment of the potential risk or impact of a successful exploit of the vulnerability. For example: Critical – within 14 days; High – within 30 days; Medium – within 90 days. The requirement to implement and document remediation actions is intended to provide additional accountability to ensure that vulnerabilities are resolved. Such documentation should include a description of the vulnerability, how it was identified, when it was identified, the systems affected, and remediation actions (e.g., patches applied, changes implemented, configuration changes made, other mitigation steps taken). For Critical or High priority flaws, the organization should document the date the remediation was completed, and if remediation has not been completed within timeframes established, the organization should document why mitigation (remediation) actions were not completed and the plan to complete them. This requirement can be fully automated and is most commonly addressed by a patch management capability that analyzes, identifies, and deploys patches in an automated manner. Organizations with less mature or manual processes will identify and address patches as notified by vendors and assign responsibility to apply the patch. Implementing this requirement typically will start as a simple manual process and mature to a more automated process as the overall cybersecurity maturity of an organization evolves.'

Real-time scans executed by malicious code protection software check all downloaded files for evidence of malicious code at time of download, open, or execution. Periodic and real-time scans are vital components of a comprehensive malicious code protection strategy. For systems with email clients, implementing anti-phishing and reputation-based services can be used to detect and take action on suspicious emails, thus helping to protect the system from malicious code. However, email filtering solutions can also filter out important security notifications (e.g., security bulletins, vulnerability alerts). Organizations consider this potential issue when implementing email filtering. Organizations must practice due diligence in ensuring security updates are not unintentionally filtered out. Behavior-based technologies (e.g., heuristics and host-based intrusion prevention systems) can detect and prevent execution of anomalous files. In the case of smaller organizations running virtual machines on a hypervisor hosted by an external provider, the hypervisor vendor is likely to offer this type of anti-malware capability as a managed service that can be readily enabled. Even in this case, organizations should implement more focused malicious code protection (e.g., anti-malicious code software, whitelisting) on devices that contain sensitive information (e.g., users handling Federal Contract Information on corporate or bring-your-own-device mobile systems).'
